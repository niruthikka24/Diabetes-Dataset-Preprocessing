# Diabetes Dataset Preprocessing

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, United States, has collected a dataset regarding the diabetes patients in Pima Woman's Hospital of Arizona. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. All the patients recorded in this dataset are females of the Pima Indian heritage. The dataset consists of 8 medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome.

This repository consists of the notebooks that were used to perform exploratory analysis on the above dataset to choose the best preprocessing pipeline.
